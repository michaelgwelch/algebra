of A Book of Abstract Algebra.


\begin{enumerate}[A.]
   \item \textsc{Practice in Multiplying and Factoring Permutations}
   \begin{enumerate}[1]
      \item Compute each of the following products in $S_9$. (Write your
      answer as a single permutation.)

      \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
         \item (145)(37)(682)

	 \solution \[ \begin{pmatrix}
	                 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\
			 4 & 6 & 7 & 5 & 1 & 8 & 3 & 2 & 9
	              \end{pmatrix} \]

	 \item (17)(628)(9354)
	 
	 \solution \[

		      \end{pmatrix}
	           \]

		      \end{pmatrix}
	           \]

	 \solution \[
	              \begin{pmatrix}
	                 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\
			 3 & 5 & 4 & 9 & 2 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 8
		      \end{pmatrix}
	           \]
      \end{enumerate}

      \item Write each of the following permutations in $S_9$ as a product
      of disjoint cycles.

      \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
         \item \[
	          \begin{pmatrix}
		      1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\

		  \end{pmatrix}
	       \]

	 \solution (145)(293)(67)

		  \end{pmatrix}
	       \]

	 \solution (17)(24)(395)(68)
	 
         \item \[
	          \begin{pmatrix}
		      1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\
		      7 & 9 & 5 & 3 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 8 & 6
		  \end{pmatrix}
	       \]

	 \solution (17435)(296)

      \end{enumerate}

      \item Express each of the following as a product of transpostions
      in $S_8$.

      \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
         \item (137428) = (18)(12)(14)(17)(13)

	 \item (416)(8235) = (46)(41)(85)(83)(82)

	 \item (123)(456)(1574) = (13)(12)(46)(45)(14)(17)(15)

	 \item $\pi = \begin{pmatrix}
	                 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
			 3 & 1 & 4 & 2 & 8 & 7 & 6 & 5
	              \end{pmatrix}$ = (1342)(58)(67) which
		      can be rewritten (12)(14)(13)(58)(67)
      \end{enumerate}

      \item If $\alpha = (3714)$, $\beta = (123)$, and $\gamma = (24135)$
      in $S_7$, express each of the following as a product of disjoint cycles:

      \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
         \item $\alpha^{-1}\beta$

	 \solution First of all $\alpha = 
	    \begin{pmatrix}
	       1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\
	       4 & 2 & 7 & 3 & 5 & 6 & 1
	    \end{pmatrix}$ and therefore $\alpha^{-1} = 
	    \begin{pmatrix}
	       1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\
	       7 & 2 & 4 & 1 & 5 & 6 & 3
	    \end{pmatrix}$, which can be rewritten as (4173). So notice
	    that to find the inverse of a permutation we just need to arrange
	    the cycle in reverse order. Now we need to calculate
	    $\alpha^{-1}\beta$: (4173)(123)

	    \[ \alpha^{-1}\beta = 
	       \begin{pmatrix}
	          1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\
		  2 & 4 & 7 & 1 & 5 & 6 & 3
	       \end{pmatrix}
	    \]

	    Now we can find disjoint cycles: (124)(37)

	    \item $\gamma^{-1}\alpha = (53142)(3714)$
	    This can be rewritten as (125374).

	    \item $\alpha^2\beta = (3714)(3714)(123)$.
	    This can be rewritten as (12)(47)

	    \item $\beta^2\alpha\gamma = (123)(123)(3714)(24135)$.
	    This can be rewritten as (1735)

	    \item $\gamma^4 = (24135)(24135)(24135)(24135)$.
	    This can be rewritten as (14253).

	    \item $\gamma^3\alpha^{-1}$ = (24135)(24135)(24135)(4173).
	    This can be rewritten as $(12345)\circ(4173) = (174235)$.

	    \item $\beta^{-1}\gamma = (31)(24135)$.
	    This can be rewritten as (2435).

	    \item $\alpha^{-1}\gamma^2\alpha = (4173)(21543)(3714)$.
	    This can be rewritten as (14275).
      \end{enumerate}

      \item In $S_5$, write (12345) in five different ways as a cycle, 
      and in five different ways as a product of transpositions.

      \solution The cycles are (12345), (23451), (34512), (45123),
      (51234). The products are (15)(14)(13)(12), (21)(25)(24)(23),
      (32)(31)(35)(34), (43)(42)(41)(45), (54)(53)(52)(51).

      \item In $S_6$, express each of the following as a square of a 
      cycle (that is, express as $\alpha^2$ where $\alpha$ is a cycle):

      \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
         \item (132). This is the square of (123).
	 \item (12345). This is the square of (14253).
	 \item (13)(24). This is the square of (1234).
      \end{enumerate}


   \end{enumerate}

   \item \textsc{Powers of Permutations}

   \noindent If $\pi$ is a permutation, we write $\pi \circ \pi = \pi^2$,
   $\pi \circ \pi \circ \pi = pi^3$, etc. The convenience of this notation
   is evident.

   \begin{enumerate}[1]
      \item Compute $\alpha^{-1}, \alpha^2, \alpha^3, \alpha^4, \alpha^5$
      where
      \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
         \item $\alpha=(123)$: $\alpha^{-1}=(321)$, $\alpha^2=(132)=
	 \alpha^{-1}$,
	 $\alpha^3=\eps$, $\alpha^4=\alpha$, $\alpha^5=\alpha^2$.

	 \item $\alpha=(1234)$: $\alpha^{-1}=(4321)$, $\alpha^2=(13)(24)$,
	 $\alpha^3=(1432)=\alpha^{-1}$, $\alpha^4=\eps$, $\alpha^5=\alpha$.

	 \item $\alpha=(123456)$: $\alpha^{-1}=(654321)$ 
	 $\alpha^2=(135)(246)$, $\alpha^3=(14)(25)(36)$, $\alpha^4=
	 (153)(264)$, $\alpha^5=(165432)=\alpha^{-1}$
      \end{enumerate}

      \vspace{5pt}
      \noindent In the following problems, let $\alpha$ be a cycle
      of length $s$, say $\alpha = (a_1a_2\dots a_s)$.
      \vspace{5pt}

      \item Describe all the \emph{distinct} powers of $\alpha$. How
      many are there? Note carefully the connection with addition of
      integers modulo $s$ (page 27).

      \noindent \solution I think the answer is there are $s$ \emph{distinct}
      powers of $\alpha$: $\alpha$ and \eps are always included. So if 
      $s$ is 2 then that's all you have.
      \begin{proof}
      The first power of $\alpha$ is $\alpha$, it takes $a_1$ to $a_2$. 
      The second power of $\alpha$
      is going to take $a_1$ to $a_3$. The third power of $\alpha$ is going
      to take $a_1$ to $a_4$. The $(s-1)^{th}$ power of $\alpha$ is going to
      take $a_1$ to $a_{1+s-1} = a_s$. Finally the $s^{th}$ power of $\alpha$
      will take $a_1$ to $a_1$. So by this we have shown that there must
      be at least $s$ \emph{distinct} powers of $\alpha$.

      However we can expand this by looking at what happens to all of 
      the elements for each power.

      \begin{align*}
          \alpha &= \begin{pmatrix}
	               a_1 & a_2 & a_3 & \cdots & a_{s-1} & a_s \\
		       a_2 & a_3 & a_4 & \cdots & a_s & a_{s-1}
	            \end{pmatrix} \\
	  \alpha^2 &= \begin{pmatrix}
	                 a_1 & a_2 & a_3 & \cdots & a_{s-1} & a_s \\
		         a_3 & a_4 & a_5 & \cdots & a_1 & a_{2}
	              \end{pmatrix} \\
		   &\vdots  \\
	  \alpha^{s-1} &= \begin{pmatrix}
	                      a_1 & a_2 & a_3 & \cdots & a_{s-1} & a_s \\
		              a_s & a_1 & a_2 & \cdots & a_{s-2}& a_{s-1}
	                  \end{pmatrix} \\
	  \alpha^s &= \begin{pmatrix}
	                 a_1 & a_2 & a_3 & \cdots & a_{s-1} & a_s \\
		         a_1 & a_2 & a_3 & \cdots & a_{s-1} & a_s
	              \end{pmatrix}		  
      \end{align*}
      As you can see there are $s$ distinct powers. 

      The connection with addition module $s$ is easier to see if we
      define $\alpha$ to be $(a_0 a_1 a_2 \dots a_{s-2} a_{s-1}$. As 
      you can see $\alpha$ is still lenght $s$. Each power $n$ of $\alpha$
      has the affect of taking some $a_i$ to $a_j$ where $j=i+n$ modulo $s$.

      If we relabel $a_s$ as $a_0$ this is exactly modulo arithmetic and
      $a_s$ even shows up in the same position that $a_0$ normally would.
      \end{proof}

      \item Find the inverse of $\alpha$ and show that $\alpha^{-1} =
      \alpha^{s-1}$. 

      \noindent \solution $\alpha^{-1} = (a_s a_{s-1} a_{s-2} \dots a_3 a_2 
      a_1)$.
      So we can see that this maps every element 
      $a_i$ to $a_j$ where $j=i-1$ (modulo s, so that $a_1$ is taken to
      $a_s$). And we know that the $(s-1)^{th}$ power moves every 
      $a_i$ to $a_j$ where $j=i+s-1=i-1$.

      \noindent Prove each of the following:

      \item $\alpha^2$ is a cycle iff $s$ is odd.

      \noindent \solution. Assume that $s$ is odd. Then we have that
      every element $a_i$ for $i+2 <= s$ is taken to 
      $a_{i+2}$. 
      This account for all of
      the elements except for $a_{s-1}$ and $a_s$. These are taken
      to $a_1$ and $a_2$ respectively. So we have the cycle
      $(a_1 a_3 a_5 \dots a_{s-2} a_s a_2 a_4 \dots a_{s-3} a_{s-1})$.

      However if $s$ is even then we get the composition of
      two cycles $(a_1 a_3 \dots a_{s-3} a_{s-1})\circ (a_2 a_4 a_6 \dots
      a_{s-2} a_s$).

      So next assume that $\alpha^2$ is a cycle. We know that if $s$
      is even then $\alpha^2$ is not a cycle. Therefore $s$ must be odd.

      \item If $s$ is odd, $\alpha$ is the square of some cycle of 
      length $s$. (Find it. \textsc{Hint}: Show $\alpha = \alpha^{s+1}$.

      \noindent \solution We know that $\alpha = \alpha^{s+1}$ as we've
      repeatedly seen evidence of this. We know that $\alpha^s$ takes
      $a_1$ to $a_1$ and in general takes $a_i$ to $a_i$. So $\alpha^s=
      eps$. Therefore, $\alpha^{s+1} = \alpha^s \alpha = \eps \alpha 
      = \alpha$.

      \hspace{0.15in} Since $s$ is odd we can rewrite it in terms of some $t$ as
      $2t+1$ (where $t=(s-1)/2$) and we can rewrite $s+1$ as $2t+2$.
      So we can rewrite $\alpha$ as $\alpha^{s+1}=\alpha^{2t+2}
      =\alpha^{t+1}\alpha^{t+1}$. So $\alpha$ can be rewritten
      as $\alpha = \beta^2$ where $\beta=\alpha^{t+1}=\alpha^{((s-1)/2)+1)}$.

      \item If $s$ is even, say $s=2t$, then $\alpha^2$ is the product
      of two cycles of length $t$. (Find them.)

      \noindent \solution We know thta $\alpha^2$ takes
      $a_i$ to $a_j$ where $j=i+2$ modulo $s$. With this information it's
      possible to identify the two cycles as
      $(a_1 a_3 a_5 \dots a_{s-3} a_{s-1})$ and 
      $(a_2 a_4 a_6 \dots a_{s-2} a_{s})$.

      \item If $s$ is a multiple of $k$, say $s=kt$, then $\alpha^k$ is
      the product of $k$ cycles of length $t$.

      \noindent \solution Proceed as in part 6. We know that
      $a_i$ is taken to $a_j$ where $j=i+k$ module $s$. Therefore
      we will have $k$ cycles: $(a_1 a_{1+k} \dots a_{s-k+1})$,
      $(a_2 a_{2+k} \dots a_{s-k+2})$, $\ldots$, 
      $(a_k a_{k+k} \dots a_s)$.

      \item If $s$ is a prime number, every power of $\alpha$ is a cycle.

      \noindent \solution Let's assume that there exists an $n$ such that
      when $s$ is prime $\alpha^n$ is the product of $m$ distinct cycles.
      Then the cycles would look like

      \begin{tabular}{c}
      $(a_1 a_{1+n} a_{1+2n} \dots a_{s-2n+1} a_{s-n+1})$ \\
      $(a_2 a_{2+n} a_{2+2n} \dots a_{s-2n+2} a_{s-n+2})$ \\
      $\vdots$ \\
      $(a_m a_{m+n} a_{m+2n} \dots a_{s-2n+m} a_{s-n+m})$
      \end{tabular}

      And we would end up with $m$ cycles each of length $s/m$. But
      this contradicts are assumption that $s$ is prime and therefore
      not divisible by $m$. Therefore $m$ must be 1.

   \end{enumerate}

   \item \textsc{Even and Odd Permutations}

   \begin{enumerate}[1]
       \item Determine which of the following permutations is even, and
       which is odd.

       \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
          \item $\pi = \begin{pmatrix}
	                  1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
			  7 & 4 & 1 & 5 & 6 & 2 & 3 & 8
	               \end{pmatrix}$

	  \noindent \solution $\pi = (173)(2456) = (13)(17)(26)(25)(24)$
	  therefore $\pi$ is odd.

	  \item (71864) \solution This is equivalent to (74)(76)(78)(71), thus
	  it is even.

	  \item (12)(76)(345) \solution Even: (12)(76)(35)(34).

	  \item (1276)(3241)(7812)
	  \noindent \solution Odd: (16)(17)(12)(31)(34)(32)(72)(71)(78)

	  \item (123)(2345)(1357) \solution even + odd + odd = even:
	  (13) (12) (25) (24) (23) (17) (15) (13).

       \end{enumerate}
       \noindent Prove each of the following

       \item \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	  \item The product of two even permutations is even.

	  \noindent \solution Assume we have two even permutations. Then
	  we know that we can write them as the product of $2m$ and $2n$
	  tranpositions for some $m,n >= 0$. Therefore the product of 
	  these two permutations can be written as the product of $2m 
	  + 2n = 2(m+n)$ transpositions. Therefore the product is even.

	  \item The product of two odd permutations is even.

	  \noindent \solution The two odd permutations can be written
	  as the product of $2m+1$ and $2n+1$ transpotitions for $m,n>=0$.
	  The product of these permutations can therefore be written
	  as the product of $(2m+1)+(2n+1)= 2m+2n+2 = 2(m+n+1)$ transpositions.
	  Therefore the product is even.

	  \item The product of an even permutation and an odd permutation
	  is odd.

	  \noindent \solution The two permutations can be written as
	  the product of $2m$ tranpositions and $2n+1$ transpositions
	  respectively. Therefore their product can be written
	  as the product of $2m+2n+1=2(m+n) + 1$ transpositions which
	  is an odd number. Therefore, the product is odd.
	  
       \end{enumerate}

       \item 
       \begin{enumerate}[(a)]

          \item A cycle of length $l$ is even if $l$ is odd.

	  \noindent \solution As shown on p83 we have the following
	  equality:
	  \[
	      (a_1a_2\cdots a_r) = (a_ra_{r-1})(a_ra_{r-2})\cdots
	                          (a_ra_3)(a_ra_2)(a_ra_1)
	  \]

	  We can see that a cycle of length $r$ can be written
	  as the product of $r-1$ transpositions. Therefore, if
	  the cycle has a length that is odd the cycle will be even 
	  (e.g. If the cycle has a length $l$ that is odd, then $l$
	  can be written as $2m+1$ for some $m$. This cycle can
	  then be written as the product of $l-1=(2m+1)-1=2m$ 
	  transpositions which is even).

	  \item A cycle of length $l$ is odd if $l$ is even.

	  \noindent \solution Same solution as part 1 except starting
	  with $l$ is even.
       \end{enumerate}

       \item 
       \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
          \item If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are cycles of length $l$ and $m$,
	  respectively, then $\alpha \beta$ is even or odd depending
	  on whether $l+m-2$ is even or odd.

	  \noindent \solution $\alpha$ and $\beta$ can each be written
	  as the product of $l-1$ and $m-1$ transpositions, respectively.
	  So their product can be written as the product of $(l-1)+(m-1)
	  = l+m-2$ transpositions. Therefore if this number is even the
	  product is even, if it is odd the product is odd.

	  \item If $\pi = \beta_1 \cdots \beta_r$, where each $\beta_i$
	  is a cycle of length $l_i$, then $\pi$ is even or odd
	  depending on whether $l_1 + l_2 + \dots + l_r - r$ is even or odd.

	  \noindent \solution Proceed as in the previous part. Each
	  $\beta_i$ can be written as the product of $l_i - 1$ transpositions.
	  Therefore $\pi$ is written as the product of $q$ transpositions
	  where $q$ is calculated as:
	  \[
	     q = \sum_{i=1}^{r} (l_i - 1) = l_1 + l_2 + \dots + l_r - r
	  \]

       \end{enumerate}

   \item \textsc{Disjoint Cycles}

   \noindent In each of the following, let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be disjoint
   cycles, say

   \begin{align*}
      \alpha &= (a_1a_2 \dots a_s) & && \beta &= (b_1b_2\dots b_r)
   \end{align*}

   \noindent Prove parts 1-3:

   \begin{enumerate}[1]
      \item For every positive integer $n$, $(\alpha \beta)^n =
      \alpha^n\beta^n$.

      \noindent \solution We can expand $(\alpha \beta)^n$:

      \begin{align*}
         (\alpha \beta)^n &= \underbrace{(\alpha \beta)(\alpha \beta) \cdots
	     (\alpha \beta)}_{n \text{ times}}
      \end{align*}

      Now, since disjoint cycles are commutative we can rearrange all
      of the terms to be

      \begin{align*}
         (\alpha \beta)^n &= \underbrace{\alpha \alpha \cdots 
	    \alpha}_{n \text{ times}} \underbrace{\beta \beta \cdots 
	    \beta}_{n \text{ times}} \\
		          &= \alpha^n \beta ^n
      \end{align*}

      \item If $\alpha \beta = \eps$, then $\alpha = \eps$ and
      $\beta = \eps$.

      \noindent \solution See the discussion of disjoint cycles on p82.
      We know that $\alpha$ moves the $a$'s while $\beta$ moves the $b$'s.
      Assume that $\alpha$ is not $\eps$. Then there is some $h$ and
      some $k$ such that $\alpha$ moves $a_h$ to $a_k$. And therefore
      $\alpha \beta$ does the same. But we know that $\alpha \beta = \eps$
      which is contradicted by our assumption. Therefore $\alpha=\eps$.
      By the same argument $\beta=\eps$.

      \item If $(\alpha \beta)^t = \eps$, then $\alpha^t = \eps$ and
      $\beta^t = \eps$.

      \noindent \solution First, we can use part 1 to note that
      $(\alpha \beta)^t = \alpha^t \beta^t$. Let $\gamma = \alpha^t$ and
      $\psi = \beta^t$. Then we have the fact that $\gamma \psi = \eps$.
      By part 2 we have the fact that $\gamma = \eps$ and $\psi = \eps$.
      Therefore $\alpha^t = \eps$ and $\beta^t = \eps$.

      \item Find a transposition $\gamma$ such that $\alpha \beta \gamma$ is
      a cycle.

      \noindent \solution Choose some $a_i$ and some $b_j$ and let
      $\gamma = (a_ib_j)$. To illustrate let's set $\gamma = (a_1b_1)$.
      Then $\alpha \beta \gamma = b_1 a_2 a_3 \cdots a_s a_1 b_2 b_3
      \cdots b_r)$.

      \item Let $\gamma$ be the same transposition as in the preceeding 
      exercise. Show that $\alpha \gamma \beta$ and $\gamma \alpha \beta$
      are cycles.

      \noindent \solution $\alpha \gamma \beta =
      (a_1 a_2 \cdots a_s)(a_1b_1)(b_1 b_2 \cdots b_t)$ which can be
      expanded to $(a_1 b_1 b_2 \cdots b_t a_2 \cdots a_s)$.

      \noindent \solution $\gamma \alpha \beta = (a_1b_1)(a_1 a_2 \cdots a_s)
      (b_1 b_2 \cdots b_t)$ which can be expanded to 
      $(a_1 a_2 \cdots a_s b_1 b_2 \cdots b_t)$.

      \item Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be cycles of odd length (not disjoint).
      Prove that if $\alpha^2 = \beta^2$, then $\alpha = \beta$.

      \noindent \solution Trivial. Prove by contradiction. Assume 
      $\alpha \ne \beta$.
