This is a reference of notation and definitions that I developed as I
often forget some of it while doing homework, and the index doesn't
have a ``notation'' index.

\begin{tabular}{lp{4in}}
  $\Reals$ & When used to refer to a group means the additive group of
  real numbers: $\langle \Reals, + \rangle$. (p.~26) \\

  $\Reals^*$ & When used to refer to a group means the multiplicative
  group of real numbers: $\langle \Reals, * \rangle$. (p.~26) \\

  $\mathbb{F}(\Reals)$ & Represents the set of all functions from
  \Reals to \Reals. When used to refer to a group it refers to the
  additive group of functions. (p.~45) \\

  $S_A$ & For any set $A$, the group of all the permutations of $A$
  is called the \emph{symmetric group on} $A$, and it is represented
  by the symbol $S_A$. (p.~71) \\

  $S_n$ & For any positive integer $n$, the symmetric group on the
  set $\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, n \}$ is called the \emph{symmetric group
    on} $n$ \emph{elements}, and is denoted by $S_n$. (p.~71) \\

\end{tabular}

Here are some definitions and some related facts.

\begin{description}
  \item[permutation] By a \emph{permutation} of set $A$ we mean a
    \emph{bijective function} from $A$ to $A$.

  \item[symmetric group] A group of all permutations of a set. The set
    may be defined by a symbol or a number. See p.~71. The operation
    implied in a symmetric group is \emph{composition}, $\circ$.
\end{description}
